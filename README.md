# PersonIpsum

Something I created very quickly when a friend made a joke about being "Lauren Ipsum"

Node terminal program that asks "who" you want to generate about. Whether it is good or bad thing to say. Then how many sentences you want.

To run navigate to directory and run `node personipsum.js`

* Very limited amount of sentences!
